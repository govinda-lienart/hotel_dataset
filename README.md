In this analysis of hotel market dynamics between Amsterdam and Brussels, I used a dataset from an unknown source with 25,380 booking records and 282 hotel entries from January to April 2021. Conducted using Python, the analysis involved preprocessing the data by handling missing values, detecting duplicates, and categorizing room types. After performing exploratory analysis to understand relationships between room prices, star ratings, and review scores, I merged two datasets based on hotel ID and applied comparative data analysis. The results highlight that while both cities share similarities in star ratings and hotel offerings, Amsterdamâ€™s hotel market is larger, with distinct pricing trends, seasonal fluctuations, and demand patterns compared to Brussels.
